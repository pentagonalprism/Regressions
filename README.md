  <p>Linear Regressions are great for understanding the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.</p>
  <p>Though the basis is simple, I have found that it's been helpful in tracking the relationship between spends and revenues when the data is well correlated.</p>
  <p>The input variable or X is the variable that helps predict the value of the output variable Y.</p>
  <p>A linear regression finds the line that best fits the data.</p>
  <p>To find this line, we use the Ordinary Least Squares Method (A method for choosing unknown parameters in a linear regression model).</p>
  <p>OLS looks to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (X) and the output of the function of the independent variable (Y).</p>
